# to-do-list
This is my first publicly available project. It is a rather primitive kind of to-do list - made with simple HTML, Vanilla JavaScript, and Bootstrap for styling purposes.

Currently it is a working prototype, but of course I do want to improve on this. These are some planned improvements:
* Add on-hoover effect in the buttons 
* Give task bullet points
* Validate task by not taking any empty string as input
* Add pop-up alerts for adding, doing, and removing within the UI
* Add a feature so that tasks can be move up and down the list 

That is pretty much it. If you have any idea, you can reach out to me via email. Feel free to do so!

I must say that I took inspiration for this project from a Traversy Media vanila JS project  called "JavaScript BookList App | No Frameworks", which is available here: https://codepen.io/bradtraversy/pen/OrmKWZ

So thanks to that channel too and all the good people who took the time to read this!
